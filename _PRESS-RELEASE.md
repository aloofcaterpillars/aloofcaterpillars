There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  One-for-One: Meals to Share 

## Sub-Heading ##
  > Describe who the market for the product is and what benefit they get. One sentence only underneath the title.

  One-for-One allows Hack Reactor students to avoid eating the same meal every day throughout the week, opening the door to an organized trading environment for food. 

## Summary ##
  > Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph good.

  Our product creates an open marketplace for Hack Reactor students to share meals. Gone are the days of eating off of the same menu throughout the week. With very limited time, it's hard for students to get creative with their cooking, and even if you're the greatest chef in the world, you'll eventually grow tired of eating the same thing. Let's face it, food just tastes better when you didn't make it. 

  One-for-One solves this problem by allowing our registered users to view meals offered up by their peers. They can search by certain ingredients and even filter out meals prohibited by various dietary restrictions. To keep the market flowing, to request a meal from another user you must also trade one of yours to them. A user can view pending requests for its meals, and view the options offered by those requesting users. Eventually, when that user has decided on the meal they'd like to receive in exchange for their own, the transaction will be confirmed. In this way, One-for-One spices up lunch and dinner time for students every day of the week. 

## Problem ##
  > Describe the problem your product solves.
  Our product solves the problem of growing tired of cooking and eating the same meal every day of the week. 

## Solution ##
  > Describe how your product elegantly solves the problem.
  One-for-One allows users to trade meals based on preference and dietary restrictions to help users enjoy a wider variety of food. 

## Quote from You ##
  > A quote from a spokesperson in your company.
  "Hack Reactor is not a normal place for bland people. It is a playground for great minds and creative collaboration. Why should the diets of students be an exception? One-for-One ensures that users can experience the same innovation in the kitchen as they do on their computers."

## How to Get Started ##
  > Describe how easy it is to get started.
  To get started, simply head to our landing page and set up an account. From here you can view all available meals, post meals that you have available, and get to trading!

## Customer Quote ##
  > Provide a quote from a hypothetical customer that describes how they experienced the benefit.
  "Since using One-for-One, I've felt rejuvenated. I was growing sick and tired of eating the same plain turkey sandwich every day. This product allows me to experience all of the culinary creativity that other students bring to the table. Now I look forward to lunch and dinner breaks!"
